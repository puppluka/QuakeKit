IN ORDER TO USE THE "QONVERTER" SCRIPT, YOU NEED TO LOCALLY INSTALL 'FFMPEG' TO YOUR SYSTEM.
THIS SCRIPT CALLS IT DIRECTLY FROM THE SYSTEM PATH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE.

Qonverter turns any mp3/wav file into the format supported by DOSQuake for compatibility purposes.
(This format is 11kHz, 8-Bit Unsigned PCM Wav, Mono Channel)

This directory is skipped by the makefile.

You should place all raw sounds and uncompressed formats in here, so you don't end up losing your work!

It would be wise not to rename it, unless you update the makefile with the new foldername.
